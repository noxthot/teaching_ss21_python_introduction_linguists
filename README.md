# teaching_ss21_python_introduction_linguists
Snippets for preparation of a ~12 hours introductory python course for linguists.

## book_alice_analysis
	(Very) Rudimentary analysis of "Alice In Wonderland" with vanilla python, nltk and spacy.
	
## language_detection
	Compare letter frequencies of loaded text document and compare to "known" letter distributions.
	Use levenshtein distance to find the closest match. This example is just for teaching purposes
	and neither best practice nor algorithmic recommendation.
	
## sentiment_analysis_movies
	Load a dataset of 25.000 labeled movie reviews. Find words which are good indicators for good
	or bad reviews. Use this information to rate a previously unseen rating.
	Again: no best practice; this is a simple coding exercise with nice insights.
	
## praesenzuebungen:
	Solutions of smaller exercises given during theory crash course.
